The Polyakov path integral is an integral over moduli space. The first five chapters of Polchinski's first volume \cite{polchinski} culminates to a measure for moduli space, known as the Polyakov Measure

    \begin{equation}

Rewriting the determinants as ghost fields, this looks like

    \begin{equation}
    \end{equation}


The goal of the first half of these notes is to gain as much geometrical intuition as possible about where these equations come from. The second half will be concerned with computing amplitudes.
