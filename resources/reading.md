# String Reading Group Pedagogy/ resources

Please add to this.

## CFT

- [Blumenhagen's book](http://www.amazon.ca/Introduction-Conformal-Field-Theory-Applications/dp/3642004490)
A straightforward introduction.

- [Di Francesco's book](http://www.amazon.com/Conformal-Theory-Graduate-Contemporary-Physics/dp/038794785X)
The standard physicist reference, a little dense.

- [Tong's notes](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/string/four.pdf) Like Polchinki and unlike the other references here this dives right into field theory and covers facts about the conformal group & algebra as it moves along. Much easier reading than Polchinski though.

- [Schottenloher: CFT for mathematicians](http://www.amazon.ca/Mathematical-Introduction-Conformal-Field-Theory/dp/3540686258)
This excels at being really clear about things that other books just gloss over, for example it discusses in detail what a central extension is.

- [M. Klaput's thesis](http://einrichtungen.ph.tum.de/T30e/research/theses/KlaputDiplomarbeit.pdf)
Jake's personal favorite - it uses the differential-geometric language you'd find Schottenloher but also gives the explicit computations useful for string theory that you would find in typical references.

## AdS/CFT

Some well-known reviews are:

- [MAGOO](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9905111)
- [D'Hoker & Freedman](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201253)
- [McGreevy](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0518)
- [Kaplan](http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~jaredk/AdSCFTCourseNotesPublic.pdf)

## Math/Geometry

- [Nakahara's book](http://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Topology-Physics-Edition-Graduate/dp/0750306068)

    - This is relevant in several ways:
        - Covers differential geometry on complex manifolds and in particular Riemann surfaces.
        - Nice chapter on bosonic string quantization & amplitudes from a geometrical perspective.
        - If you don't know homology & cohomology the summary given here is super clear.

## Generic/everything

- [The IAS volumes](https://www.math.ias.edu/qft) has chapters on strings, CFTs, SUSY, etc.
